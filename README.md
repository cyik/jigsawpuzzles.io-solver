This is a version 4 of my automated puzzle solver for jigsawpuzzles.io online puzzle solving game. The accuracy of each puzzle guess is about 98% accuracy.

To use this, simply screenshot the puzzle piece that you want to find the position of, and then paste it into the GUI, the GUI will then pop-up a new window that shows the top 3 likeliest guesses of where the puzzle piece goes. You also need to provide a picture of the complete solved puzzle in full HD. It is very important that you read the README.dox before you start to use the tool. It won't work if you don't follow it exactly.
